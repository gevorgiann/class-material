# Lecture Notes for Oct 26, 2021


## Announcements:
  1. A new grading procedure was put into place
     - expidates the processing of online grading
     - it uses automation technics to perform many of the mandane tasks
     - it requires _your_ submissions to follow a defined specification
       - via later labs, we saw this defined specification emerge
       - double check your previous lab scores to see if your submission was not graded
         - if not, fix the issue
         - commit and push your changes
         - notify me you want something regraded

  1. We pick up where we left off on the digital logic section


## Questions:
   1. (M) None..
   1. (A)

## New Materal

### From the Slides:

#### Last time review: Intro to Digital Logic
  1. Circuts (Digital Logic) -- Boolean Algebra
     - Basic Gates: AND, OR, NOT
  1. Truth Tables -- everyone has had them... no big deal
     - Large Truth Table with ALL possible outputs
     - The number of functions that exist grow rapidely as we allow more inputs.
  1. Sum of Products
     - generate a circuit quickly via the Boolean Algeabra 
     - from ciruit, I could quickly come up the Boolen Ageabra

### Combinational Circuits
  1. 1-Bit Building Blocks
     - Half Adder
     - Full Adder
  1. n-Bit Operations

### For next time.
  1. Control devices
     - Encoder / Decoder
     - Multiplexer / Demultiplexer
