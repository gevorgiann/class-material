   1. (A) None...

## New Materal:

### From the Slides:

#### Last time review: Combinational Circuits.pdf
 
### Combinational Circuits
  1. Sum of Products from Truth-Table, build a circuit
  1. Used Algebraic Properties to achieve minimized circuits
     - lots, and lots of different equivalents can be achieved
  1. Kaungh Map (K-maps)
     - Offered a different perscpective to see what we could see
     - exploit opportunities for minimization
  1. Divide & Conquer -- backwards to 
   - go from a circuit to Boolean Algrebra
  1. 1-Bit Building Blocks
     - Half Adder : 2 inputs -> 2 outputs
     - Full Adder : 3 inputs -> 2 outputs
      - taking the truth table and generate circuit
      - use two Half-Adders, but add some gates to make it work

  1. 4-Bit Operations
     - extend in parallel 
     - complement (use of the NOT gate) and +1 
     - +1 is the magic use of the inital carry bit 

### For next time.
  1. Control devices
     - Encoder / Decoder
     - Multiplexer / Demultiplexer
