## Agenda:
  1. Review previous day material, quickly
  1. Note any Announcements
  1. Garner any questions


## What we did last time, and were we left off

1. Instruction Encoding
   1. MIPS: all instructions encoded in a single word: 32 bits
   1. Three primary types of instruction formats:  R, I, J
   1. The opcode (first 6 bits) determines with format to use
   1. Registers, immediate, and address encode within the 32 bits
      - 32 registers so, we need 5 bits to encode each register
      - immediate are 16 bits (positive or negative)
      - addresses are 26 bits 
   1. Examples Encoding and Decoding
