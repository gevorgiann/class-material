  1. Pickup where we left off
     - 9/16: Variables and Memory
     - Lvals and Rvals: 
       - every variable has a location in memory, it's lval
       - every variable has a value stored in memory, it's rval
     - When making a system call:
       - you often need to pass a buffer
       - the buffer is always identifed by its "lval", and not it's rval
       - the lval is often refered to as a "pointer"
     - Notation for Lval
       - user the "&" to request the lval of a variable, e.g., &var.
       - you can store the lval of a variable into an other variable
         - the variable holding the lval is know as a pointer
           - int * pointer = & variable

  1. Start a new section: Encodings
